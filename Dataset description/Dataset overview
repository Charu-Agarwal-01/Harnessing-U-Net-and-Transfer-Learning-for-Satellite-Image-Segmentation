## Dataset Overview: 
We used the **[Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Imagery](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamednadjib/aerial-image-segmentation)** dataset from Kaggle for this blog. The dataset features high-resolution aerial imagery of Dubai, collected by MBRSC satellites, and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation across six distinct classes.

The dataset consists of two types of files:
*jpg images*: These are the original aerial photographs captured through satellite, representing the real visual input.
*png images*: These serve as the segmentation masks, where each pixel is labeled according to a predefined semantic class. 
  These masks act as the ground truth for training and evaluating the model.

Each image has a corresponding mask with pixel-wise alignment, ensuring that the input and its label match perfectly.
*Total Images*: 72
*Total corresponding masks*: 72
*Grouped Tiles*: 8 large composite tiles
*Image Type*: High-resolution RGB aerial imagery
*Annotation Type*: Per-pixel semantic segmentation mask
